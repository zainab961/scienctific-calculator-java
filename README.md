##Java Scientific Calculator
Description
This is a console-based scientific calculator written in Java. It can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as scientific functions such as power, square root, logarithms (log10 and ln), and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
The calculator is menu-driven, allowing the user to select an operation and input numbers. It also handles errors like division by zero and invalid inputs for logarithms or square roots.
